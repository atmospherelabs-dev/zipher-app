# Atmosphere Labs — Brand Philosophy

> "Invisible by design."

## Who We Are

Atmosphere Labs builds open-source infrastructure that makes Zcash accessible — for users who want privacy without complexity, and developers who need tools to build on.

## Our Position

**Apple meets Linux Foundation.**

- **Apple side:** Obsessive about design, "it just works," invisible complexity, human-centric, premium feel.
- **Linux side:** Open-source, transparent, community-owned, robust, anti-surveillance.

ZODL maintains the protocol. Shielded Labs does the research. We are the consumer and developer layer — we take their hard work and make it usable for humans and buildable for developers.

## Voice

- Confident and short, technically precise.
- Heavy on "We build" — never heavy on "We believe."
- *"Making Zcash accessible. For everyone."*

## Principles

1. **Privacy as a Default** — If it's not private by default, we don't ship it.
2. **User Sovereign** — Your keys, your data, your terms. Always.
3. **Radically Accessible** — For users and developers alike. Design is our tool, not our goal.
4. **Open Source** — Every line is public. We don't ask for trust, we show our work.
5. **Invisible Complexity** — Make the math disappear behind great UX.
